# PluginLibrary

A simple rewritten framework for Minecraft plugins that run on CraftBukkit cores<br>
(named after a smol midget)
</div>

### Why another?

Why not?

### Why should I use this?

This library was built as a shaded library, which means that you will have to bundle every class of this library for the projects to work. There is no other external plugin to
depend on.

Since this library was split into smaller modules, such as `commands`, `collections`, `nbt`, etc., users can specify which modules they want to use, and minimize the resulting
.jar. This means that this library can be used in any kind of projects, that might already have worked against a framework.

### Documentation

Maybe in wikis soon?
